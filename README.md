# re-CYCLE
Project for ECS524U

The aim of this project was to create a website for a startup company, where we chose to create a bike sharing page.

Based off of the digital [prototypes](https://github.com/WebDesignGroup7/re-CYCLE/tree/master/designPrototypes), we implemented the design using Bootstrap and HTML/CSS.
